# Limitations

This library just like other libraries uses compiler-specific hacks based on `__FUNCSIG__` / `__PRETTY_FUNCTION__`.

If you face any issues while using the library don't hesistate to open up an issue.

## Forward Declared Enums

This library cannot reflect on forward declared enums you will get a cryptic error usually telling you that you are not initializing a variable in a constexpr context.

The reason is to avoid ODR issues, where you reflect on a forward declared enum in one translation unit then reflect the full definition in another unit you will face ODR issues.

But however this disallows reflection of empty enums.

```cpp
enum class Empty {};
```

Cannot be reflected as a consequence of disabling forward declared enums.

## Enum Range

Enum values must be in the range [`ENCHANTUM_MIN_RANGE`,`ENCHANTUM_MAX_RANGE`] 
By default, `ENCHANTUM_MIN_RANGE` = -256, `ENCHANTUM_MAX_RANGE` = 256. 

If you need a different range for all enum types by default, redefine the macro `ENCHANTUM_MAX_RANGE` and if you don't explicitly define `ENCHANTUM_MIN_RANGE` it will be `-ENCHANTUM_MAX_RANGE`. Increasing this value can lead to longer compilation times but unlike other libraries it is not massivly increasing [see benchmarks](../README.md#benchmarks).

Enum values outside of this range won't be reflected by enchantum.

Enums that satisfy the `BitFlagEnum` concept ignore the [min, max] range, and reflect:
- The 0 value
- All powers-of-two up to the max bit set

*Note: Defining the macro values project wide is recommended to avoid ODR issues*

```cpp
#define ENCHANTUM_MIN_RANGE 0 // if not defined it will be -512
#define ENCHANTUM_MAX_RANGE 512
#include <enchantum/enchantum.hpp>
```

If you need a different range for a specific enum type, add the specialization `enum_traits` for the enum type.

```cpp
#include <enchantum/enchantum.hpp>

enum class wizards { longbeard = 300, midbeard = 400, redbearded = 600 };

template <> 
struct enchantum::enum_traits<wizards> { // defined in enchantum/common.hpp you only need that header
  static constexpr auto min = static_cast<int>(wizards::longbeard);
  static constexpr auto max = static_cast<int>(wizards::redbearded);
};
```

## Other Compiler Issues

If you see a message that goes like this

```
note: constexpr evaluation hit maximum step limit; possible infinite loop? 
```
or
```
maximum constexpr step count exceeded. 
```
Which is rare, since this library optimizes `constexpr` steps needed to reflect so you will only really hit this with extremely large rangesl ike 
Change the limit for the number of `constexpr` steps allowed: (hyperlink to docs)

[MSVC](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/cpp/build/reference/constexpr-control-constexpr-evaluation): `/constexpr:depthN, /constexpr:stepsN`

[Clang](https://clang.llvm.org/docs/UsersManual.html#controlling-implementation-limits): `-fconstexpr-depth=N, -fconstexpr-steps=N`

[GCC](https://gcc.gnu.org/onlinedocs/gcc-14.2.0/gcc/C_002b_002b-Dialect-Options.html#index-fconstexpr-depth): `-fconstexpr-depth=N, -fconstexpr-loop-limit=N, -fconstexpr-ops-limit=N`

## Unscoped enums in templates may not work correctly on Ð¡lang or GCC 10.

Clang is super weird with these enums

```cpp
template<typename T>
struct ReallyClang_QuestionMark {
    enum Type {
        A,B,C
    };
};

enchantum::entries<ReallyClang_QuestionMark<int>::Type>; // some long compiler error
```

Apparantly Clang optimizes unused  enum names in templates? I don't know really but a workaround is this (you must atleast mention the name of an enumarator once)

```cpp
template<typename T>
struct GoodClang {
    enum Type_ {
        A,B,C
    };

    using Type = decltype(Type_::A);
};

enchantum::entries<GoodClang<int>::Type>; // happy clang
```

GCC 10 Straight up won't output anything correct about those enums.

So don't use GCC 10 with enums inside templates.

This is fixable but requires much work. if heavily wanted though I will make it.

## Unscoped Enums

unnamed unscoped enums are not supported except on msvc

```cpp
enum {
    SomeConstant = 10;
};

using Type = decltype(SomeConstant);
enchantum::entries<Type>; // won't work and won't be officially supported
```

this works

```cpp
typedef enum {
    SomeConstant = 10;
} Type;
```

just give it a name.
